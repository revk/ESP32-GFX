// 5x9 based vector font.
// This is the vector data.
// Each character is a sequence of bytes based on the offset table below, to start of next character.
// The bytes are :-
// Top it for 'start of line'.
// Three bits X (from left).
// Four bits Y (from top).
// A line can just have a start, for a dot.
